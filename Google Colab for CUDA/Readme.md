# How to Use Google Colab to Run CUDA Codes
In this tutorial, I'm going to provide some tips to run CUDA (C or C++) codes on Google Colab.

For running CUDA codes we need a NVIDIA GPU, but some people don't have access to these GPUs. Fortunately, Google has provided this capability in its Colab, andit is possible to run our CUDA codes on it for free! Follow this tutorial to do so:

## Step1
1. Open your browser and go to https://colab.research.google.com

2. Go to ```File->New Notebook``` (it may ask for type of Notebook, then choose "Python 3 Notebook")

3. Go to ```Runtime->Change runtime type``` and change the Harware accelerator to GPU
